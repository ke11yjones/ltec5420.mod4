<p>One of the most satisfying things I’ve come across is the feeling of growing something from a seed or seedling. As a child I remember watching my grandfather tend to his garden and my grandmother care for her plants and flowers and they always seemed so relaxed and content. Throughout the years I’ve had various plants that I’ve grown, but they were already well established by the time they made it to me. Beyond admiring the growing skills of others, I never really considered the hobby for myself until the world stopped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>	  
<p>The pandemic brought about the emergence of many new and well-established hobbies, one of which being gardening. Like most folks, the sudden realities of “stay-at-home” orders afforded me with a LOT of free time. So after streaming excessive amounts of television, I decided to try my hand at gardening. Through this hobby I have constantly learned new things, experienced the joys of growing my own food (just tomatoes so far), and the agony of losing the on-going battle with pests like ants and grasshoppers. Gardening has given me a new appreciation for the flowers and produce I see in the stores because now I know how easily the process can be disrupted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This site is dedicated to the little bit of knowledge and experience that I have gained through my gardening hobby.</p>
